        You might wonder why CSS works in such a messy way, displaying content outside of its intended container.
        Why not hide overflowing content? Why not scale the size of the container to fit all the content?

        Wherever possible, CSS does not hide content. This would cause data loss. The problem with data loss is that
        you might not notice. Website visitors may not notice. If the submit button on a form disappears and no one
        can complete the form, this could be a big problem! Instead, CSS overflows in visible ways. You are more
        likely to see there is a problem. At worst, a site visitor will let you know that content is overlapping.

        If you restrict a box with a width or a height, CSS trusts you to know what you are doing. CSS assumes that
        you are managing the potential for overflow. In general, restricting the block dimension is problematic when
        the box contains text. There may be more text than you expected when designing the site, or the text may be
        larger. (for example, if the user has increased their font size)

        The next two lessons explain different approaches to control sizing in ways that are less prone to overflow.
        However, if you need a fixed size, you can also control how the overflow behaves. Let's read on!</p>
